## Language Contributing

This is intended for anyone wishing to contribute translations to the project.

### Branch Naming
A branch must be created in order to contribute to the project.
Unless you have permissions to create branches in Amulet-Team you will first need to [fork the repository](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo).
You must then create a branch with an identifiable name using the following convention:

* When adding languages, use: `impl-lang-<langauge code>`
* When fixing languages, use: `improv-lang-<langauge code>`

### Pull Requests
Once you have added the desired changes you will need to [create a pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request). 
We ask that submitted Pull Requests give moderately detailed notes about the changes.

Once a Pull Request is submitted, we will mark the request for review.
Once that is done, we will review the changes and may provide feedback on things to change.
Once all additional changes have been made, we will merge the request.
